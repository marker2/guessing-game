Design
========================

This is a simple game. The only button on the page initiates a quick javascript game 
that asks the user to guess the color randomly generated as the "computer's choice." 
Most interaction happens between strings entered by the user in prompt dialogs and 
alerts generated in response. At a right response, the game ends. At a wrong response, 
a new color is selected and the user is encouraged to try again, up to 10 tries. After 
that, the user is returned to the page with an updated button asking him to try again.

For some fun, enter "milk and eggs" as your first guess.


To run
========================

Download the files locally and launch index.html in a browser to begin the game.
